### Rootkit based on Jynx 1.0

This is a simple rootkit written by me to understand how rootkits work, as an appetizer to learn before going full send on my bachelor thesis.

Please don't use this repo or my code for evil reasons. Please and thank you.

## TODO:

2. Write malicious library
1. Create an open port (X) -> encrypt the connection
3. Hide the open port -> i think i should hook open. when open reads the file for my connection, just ignore it and dont write anything
4. Hide process
5. Hide file
5. Provide encrypted password protected backdoor
